# week-3-game
Overview

In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Hangman or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML powered by your JavaScript code.

*Before You Begin

  1. Create a new GitHub repo called week-3-game, then clone it to your computer. DONE

  2. Inside your local week-3-game folder, create the following: index.html, composer.json and index.php DONE

    2.1. Fill in the appropriate content in the composer.json and index.php files to be able to deploy your game to heroku when it is finished. DONE
    2.2. While still in your week-3-game directory, make a folder called assets. DONE
    2.3. cd your way into the assets folder, then make three additional folders: javascript, css and images. DONE
    2.4. In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js. DONE
    2.5. In the css folder, make a file called style.css. DONE
    2.6. Also in the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code from the Meyerweb reset stylesheet. DONE
    2.7. In the images folder, save whatever images you plan on using.

  3. Push the above changes to GitHub.
  
Choose whichever game you'd like to make. Making the Psychic game will prove easier than coding Hangman. Yet the challenges inherit to the Hangman exercise will provide you a more comprehensive review of this week's material. We'd suggest at least trying Hangman first.
Note: There's no shame if you'd prefer submitting Psychic. Don't worry, it's still a proper challenge :)
Push your selected game to heroku. Remember:
heroku login
heroku create
git push heroku master
